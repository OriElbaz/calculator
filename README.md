# Calculator Project

This is a simple web-based calculator built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It was developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum and is designed to reinforce core programming concepts through a practical, interactive project.

## Features

* Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Interactive on-screen buttons for all inputs
* Clear and delete functions for managing input
* Decimal point support
* Handles division by zero with appropriate error messages
* Limits output to 10 characters to fit display constraints
* Manages internal state between operands and operators

## Learning Objectives

This project focuses on:

* Strengthening understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
* Practising DOM manipulation and event-driven programming
* Building interactive, user-focused web applications
* Structuring logic and handling application state
* Integrating JavaScript with HTML and CSS for dynamic interfaces

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)

## Project Structure

```
calculator/
├── index.html       // HTML structure for display and controls
├── styles.css       // Styles for layout and design
└── script.js        // JavaScript logic and event handling
```

## Potential Future Improvements

* Add keyboard input support
* Enable operation chaining (e.g. 2 + 3 \* 4 without pressing equals after each step)
* Improve responsive design for mobile users
* Add visual feedback for active or pressed buttons
* Refactor for cleaner and more modular code
